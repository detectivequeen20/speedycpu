Hello People of the internet!

To use this program, simply extract everything from this zipped file, and run Internet.bat

Internet.bat is on a consistent loop. So ever 45 seconds it will run its cleaning program, to ensure cache and trash files 
(normally left by your computer on regular use of anything) are deleted, so that your computer can run smoothly.

THIS IS NOT A SECURITY PROGRAM, AND RUNS ENTIRELY OFFLINE!!

Meaning, no copying, no tracing, no nothing.

Please ensure the the folder EMPTYSTANDBYLIST and Internet.bat are in the same folder.

You are free to edit this program in anyway you wish, I am however not responsible if you edit the file and something breaks on your device.

If a download or install is interupted or crashes unexpectly, simply close the program, and restart your download or install.

This program requires you to MANUELLY start up the program (as I have not made it smart in anyway).
